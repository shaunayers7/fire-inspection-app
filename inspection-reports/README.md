# Inspection Reports

This folder contains **original, untouched reference files** for fire inspections.

## Purpose
- **Reference only** - these files are NEVER modified by the app
- Copy/paste text from these files to import into the app
- Use at job sites if you need to verify or fix data after importing
- Backup of original inspection reports

## Structure
- `/2025/` - Completed 2025 inspection reports (for import)
- `/2026/` - Current year inspection reports

## Usage
1. Store your original inspection text files here
2. Open the app and navigate to the year
3. Click "Import" button
4. Open the text file from this folder
5. Copy the contents and paste into the import dialog
6. If something looks wrong in the app, reference these original files to fix it

**Note:** The app only reads text you paste - it never touches these files.
